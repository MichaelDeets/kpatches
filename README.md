DO NOT USE

These are patches taken from:

    https://github.com/CachyOS/kernel-patches

    https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg

    https://github.com/xanmod/linux-patches

put in order, and stuffed inside `/etc/portage/patches/sys-kernel/vanilla-sources`

This is purely a personal backup, would not recommend attempting to use.
